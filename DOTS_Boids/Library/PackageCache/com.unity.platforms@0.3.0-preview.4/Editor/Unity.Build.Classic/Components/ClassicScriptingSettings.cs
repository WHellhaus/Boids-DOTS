        //       - Editor will not reflect the same set compilation result as building to player, which is not very good.
        //       - We need to either decide to have somekind of global project settings (used both in Editor and while building to player) or have
        //         "active build settings" property which would be used as information what kind of enviromnent to simulate, in this it may make sense to but 'ScriptingDefineSymbols, ApiCompatibilityLevel, AllowUnsafeCode' here
