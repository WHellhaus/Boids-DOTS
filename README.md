This is a video highlighting my implementation of the Boids simulation developed by Craig Reynolds, which I was inspired to make after finding Sebastian Lague's video on the topic. My simulation applies the rules of separation, alignment, cohesion and object avoidance to simulate how a school of fish might swim together. 

The simulation runs extremely fast in parallel thanks to the job system, the entity component system and the burst compiler from Unity's data-oriented technology stack. Shaders are made using the Universal Render Pipeline and GPU instancing. Footage was taken on a 2017 macbook at 4k 60fps with 1000 entities or more simulated at once.
